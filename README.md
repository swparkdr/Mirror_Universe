## 🌌 Overview  
The **Mirror Universe** is an ongoing experiment exploring how 21st-century humans perceive themselves through the reflections they create — social, digital, and emotional.  
In a world overflowing with data and representation, we’ve learned to project images of who we are, but not always to understand what those images mean.  

This repository gathers the fragments of that reflection — from **architectural design** and **visual storytelling** to **emotion-aware AI** and **interactive systems**.  
Each fragment acts as a mirror, capturing a trace of thought, feeling, or memory, transforming it into a structure that can be observed, analyzed, and felt again.

## 🧩 Philosophy  
> “We are made of reflections — fragments of light, emotion, and memory.”  

**Mirror Universe** is not a product, but a **living inquiry**.  
It exists between *design, code, and philosophy*, asking what it means to be human in an era where every gesture is mirrored, stored, and recomposed by technology.  

By merging emotional computation, architectural reasoning, and digital art, this space seeks to answer one question:  
> Can we still recognize ourselves within an infinite loop of mirrors?
